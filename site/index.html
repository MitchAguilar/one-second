        <h3>Do YOU know how fast your computer is?!</h3>
        <p>
        Welcome to the "how fast is a computer" game! All of these programs have a variable NUMBER in them. Your mission: guess how big NUMBER needs to get before the program takes 1 second to run.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't need to guess exactly: they're all between 1 and a billion. Just try to guess the right order of magnitude!
