        Let's find out how well you know computers! All of these programs have a variable NUMBER in them. Your mission: guess how big NUMBER needs to get before the program takes 1 second to run.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't need to guess exactly: they're all between 1 and a billion. Just try to guess the right order of magnitude! A few notes:

            <ul>
              <li> If the answer is 38,000, both 10,000 and 100,000 are considered correct answers. The goal is to not be wrong by <i>more</i> than 10x :) </li>
              <li> We know computers have different disk & network & CPU speeds! We're trying to get you to tell the difference between code that can run 10 times/s and 100000 times/s. A newer computer won't make your code run 1000x faster :) </li>
              <li> That said, all this was run on a new laptop with a fast SSD and a sketchy network connection. </li>
            </ul>

            Good luck! We were surprised by a lot of these. We'll be
            anonymously collecting your answers, so expect some graphs in the
            future! =D
